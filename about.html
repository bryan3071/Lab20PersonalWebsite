<h1>My About Me Page</h1>
<br>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I attended Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, due to it's close proximity to home and family and it's good business programs.
I completed a Bachelor of Science in Human Resource Management. Everyone told me I should get a Masters Degree, so I went back to Oakland University a short time later and completed my MBA specializing in Finance and Management Information Systems.
As my career started to progress in information technology, I gained an interest in cyber security. I went back to school at Macomb Community College and completed an Associates of Applied Science in Network Security 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I started my full
 time working career as a Technical Recruiter. My 
 responsibilities included placing engineering and design
  professionals, primarily on contract positions, with our
   clients in the automotive industry. While I enjoyed being a
    recruiter, I started developing an interest in the 
    information technology field, and was able to obtain a position 
    with Chimes Inc in various roles that eventually led me to become 
    to team lead of production support for a team of support analysts
     located in Troy, MI and Montreal, Quebec. Chimes ended up being
      a great fit because they made software that helped companies 
      manage their vendor management around staffing companies. From 
      there I went to Kelly Services, where I worked on implementation
       of partner VMS applications in support of Kelly's activity of 
       managing their client's contingent workforce hiring. Finally, 
       my most recent position was a client support position for a 
       company called erecruit, which built software applications 
       which supported staffing companies. For this position with 
       erecruit, I worked remotely from home   </p>
