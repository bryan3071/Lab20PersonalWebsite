<p>I have listed below, several of my class daily labs that I enjoyed the most. 

</p>

<ol>
<li>LAB-3-CONDITIONALS - This lab was an exercise in creating 
conditionals. The user took an input of a number, and the program 
evaluated whether the value was odd or even and where it appeared 
among various intervals from 1 to 100. click <a href = "https://github.com/bryan3071/lab-3-Conditionals">here</a></li>

<li>LAB-4-TABLE OF POWERS - This lab requested for the user to 
provide a number. Once that number was entered, the user is provided 
with an output of a table of numbers from 1 to the number selected, 
and their respective square and cube values. click <a href = "https://github.com/bryan3071/Lab-4-TableofPowers">here</a></li>

<li>LAB-10-MOVIES AND OBJECTS - This lab stored a list of movies in 
an array list, listing name and genre. The application then asked the 
user to choose from a list of movie categories. Once the user listed 
which movie category/genre that they were interested in, the 
application presented them with the names of the movies that fit that 
category.click <a href = "https://github.com/bryan3071/Lab10MoviesAndObjects">here</a></li>
