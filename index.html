	<h2>Developing</h2>
	<p>I have been learning programming, while using Java for about one month now. It has been a challenging endeavor, but I am really enjoying the experience.

	<h2>Hometown</h2>
	<p> I am a lifelong resident of Southeastern Michigan in the 
	Detroit area. I went to public schools in the Warren and Sterling Heights areas, and college in Warren and Rochester, MI.
	As a sports fan, growing up in the Detroit area, I was afforded the opportunity to enjoy four major sports teams and two large universities.
